# Sales-Dashboard---Power-BI

**1. Introduction:**
The project aims to provide comprehensive insights into sales and profit data across different segments, states, cities, and ship modes. It involves the creation of multiple visualizations and dashboards using Power BI to analyze and present the data effectively.

**2. Methodology:**
The methodology involves gathering data related to sales, profit, customer segments, states, cities, ship modes, and dates. The data is cleaned, transformed, and loaded into Power BI for visualization. Visualizations are designed based on the specific requirements of each task, and dashboards are created to combine and present the visualizations in a cohesive manner.

**3. Requirement Analysis:**
The requirements for the project include:
- Analyzing sales and profit data by customer segments and months on Page 1.
- Visualizing sales and profit data by state and city on Page 2.
- Creating a visualization of sales vs. profit daily on Page 3.
- Displaying total sales by ship mode and profit by month, along with calculating total customer IDs on Page 4.
- Mapping sales data by state on Page 5.
- Combining all visualizations from Pages 1 to 5 into a single dashboard on the Dashboard Page.

**4. Other Parameters depending upon the Projects:**
Additional parameters may include:
- Performance optimization for large datasets.
- Incorporating user feedback and iteration for dashboard improvements.
- Integration of real-time data updates.
- Designing interactive elements for better user engagement.

**5. All Visualizations:**
The visualizations in the project include:
- Bar charts, line charts, and maps for visualizing sales, profit, and customer data across different dimensions such as segments, states, cities, ship modes, and dates.
- Tables and matrices for displaying detailed data and calculations such as total sales and profit.
- Slicers and filters for interactive data exploration and analysis.

**6. Insights from the Charts as well as Dashboards:**
Insights derived from the visualizations and dashboards include:
- Identification of top-performing customer segments, states, and cities.
- Analysis of sales and profit trends over time and by different dimensions.
- Understanding the impact of ship modes on total sales.
- Mapping geographical distribution of sales to identify potential market opportunities.
- Correlation between sales and profit on a daily basis.

**7. Conclusion:**
The project provides valuable insights into sales and profit data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and optimize business performance. By leveraging the visualizations and dashboards created, organizations can identify key trends, patterns, and opportunities for growth, ultimately leading to improved business outcomes and customer satisfaction.
